# GoMR

GoMR is a super-fast, super-simple, super-easy-to-debug mapreduce framework
for Go. Written to deploy Mapreduce jobs without dealing with the JVM, to
easily debug code, to improve performance, and to write code in Go!

## Getting started

This project has been revitalized after several years of being dormant.
See `UPDATES.md` for a work log on what is changing and next steps.

For now, your best bet is to visit one of the git tags for a "working build" of the project.
I will not being developing features on a separate branch, so the current mainline
version is not expected to be fully featured or functional.
